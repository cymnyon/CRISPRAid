# CRISPRAid

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CRISPRAid is an R package designed to facilitate comprehensive analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) data, enabling researchers to evaluate gRNA efficiency, assess off-target risks, analyze sequence composition, and visualize results. CRISPRAid includes tools for simulating off-target effects, computing mutation-induced insertions and deletions (indels), and generating informative plots to support data interpretation and decision-making in CRISPR experiments.

The package was developed using R version 4.3.1 and has been optimized to work efficiently on this platform.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CRISPRAid from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cymnyon/CRISPRAid")
```

## Overview

CRISPRAid includes the following functions:

- **analyze_gRNA_efficiency**: Computes the efficiency of gRNA sequences, helping determine their suitability for targeting.
- **evaluate_gRNA_specificity**: Assesses gRNA specificity against target sequences to reduce off-target effects.
- **compute_indels**: Calculates the frequency of indels in sequencing data, aiding in mutation rate analysis.
- **simulate_off_target_effects**: Simulates potential off-target binding across a genome, providing a risk profile for each gRNA.
- **visualize_gRNA_efficiency**: Generates a heatmap of gRNA efficiencies for visual comparison.
- **visualize_gRNA_base_composition**: Creates a bar plot to display nucleotide composition (A, T, G, C) of gRNA sequences.
- **plot_off_target_map**: Maps predicted off-target sites across a genome, offering insights into binding distribution.

## Example Usage

Here’s a basic example demonstrating CRISPRAid’s functionality. Load the package and use some of the core functions:

```{r}
# Load CRISPRAid in development mode
if (requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  devtools::load_all(".")
} else {
  message("Please install the 'devtools' package to load CRISPRAid in development mode.")
}

# Example of computing gRNA efficiency
efficiency_result <- analyze_gRNA_efficiency("GACGTCTAGT", "TGCTACGTAG")

# Example of visualizing base composition
gRNA_seqs <- c("GACGTCTAGT", "TGCATCTAGG", "GACGTGTAGT")
visualize_gRNA_base_composition(gRNA_seqs)
```

## Contributions

CRISPRAid was developed by Soomi Choi with the following contributions:

- **analyze_gRNA_efficiency**: Authored by Soomi Choi using R’s built-in error handling and control structures to ensure efficient gRNA performance analysis.
- **evaluate_gRNA_specificity**: Developed to quantify gRNA accuracy by reducing off-target effects; inspiration was drawn from off-target analysis techniques in CRISPR research.
- **compute_indels**: Written to calculate indel frequencies, this function validates inputs carefully, based on the author’s original logic.
- **simulate_off_target_effects**: Built to model potential off-target sites using random sampling; Soomi Choi implemented the simulation logic with R’s random number generation functions.
- **Visualization Functions**: Each visualization function was designed by Soomi Choi to ensure that CRISPR data analysis outputs are clear and easily interpretable.
