\title{Analyze gRNA Efficiency}
\usage{
analyze_gRNA_efficiency(gRNA_seq, target_seq, model = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gRNA_seq}{A character string representing the guide RNA sequence.}

\item{target_seq}{A character string representing the target DNA sequence.}

\item{model}{A model object (optional) for prediction.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns for gRNA sequence and predicted efficiency.
}
\description{
This function predicts the editing efficiency of a specified guide RNA (gRNA)
sequence against a target DNA sequence, providing insight into the likelihood
of successful CRISPR editing at the target site. Efficiency is calculated
based on sequence properties, such as GC content and sequence similarity,
or by using a provided predictive model. The output includes the gRNA sequence,
target sequence, and a predicted efficiency score, which can guide researchers
in selecting optimal gRNA candidates.
